CSS child parent shit 
<div>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p> <!-- Direct child of the div -->
    <span>
        <p>Paragraph 2</p> <!-- Descendant of the div (but not a direct child) -->
    </span>
</div>
div p : selects all descendants of div that are p (para 1 and 2)
div > p: selects only children of div that are p (para 1)
--------------------------
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
<p>Paragraph 3</p>

h1+p (immediate sibling) (first sibling of h1 that is also p) (paragraph1)
h1 ~ p (all siblings(that came after h1) of h1) (para 1,2,3)

ul li very simple syntax (ul is unordered list, ol is ordered list btw)
<ul>
<li> item 1</li>
<li> item 2</li>
<li> item 3</li>
</ul>
so you can do ul li:fist-child
ul li: last-chile
ul >li:nth-child(2)
there's this thing called focus, which basically what it does is, if something is in focus (like oyu cliked on it or navigated w tab) you can do something
like input[type="email"]:focus 
{
    border: 2px solid blue;
}
div > p:first-child selects the first child of div iff it is a p.
also, you can do div#wut > p ORRRR ul.class1 li: first-child
