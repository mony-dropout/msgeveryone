ok so iframe is something that is used to link to another page in your page...
like youtube video embeds, pop up logins etc... so the way to interact w it using selenium is a bit differenet, first you gotta
tell selenium to switch to iframe (by number (life first/second third iframe etc is 0,1,2) or id or smthn)
the way to wrie i frame in html is very easy, just like a href,
<html>
<head>
<title>working</title>
</head>
<body>
<h>having fun</h>
<br><br>
<iframe id="first" src="https://example.com" width="500" height="420"></iframe> //maybe google youtube wont load this easy lmao
<br><br>
<p> how does this feel</p>
</body>
</html>
how to do selenium here is
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time
driver=webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("file:///Users/monyatwu/Documents/first%20project/testhtml.html")
time.sleep(5)
ifr=driver.find_element(By.ID,"myframe")
driver.switch_to(ifr)
//do whatever the fuck you wanna do here
//like x=driver.find_elenent() or whatever 
and then finally do 
driver.switch_to.default_content()


XPATH!!!
this is really cool, its a way to find elements, the syntax is basically
//tagname[@attribute='value']
tagname=div,button,p,h1,input etc.
attribute=class,id, text
examples:
//input[@id='username'] (find inputs w id username)
//button[text()='login'] (find button w text login)
//div[@class='container'] (finds div element w class =container)
//*[@id='search'] (finds any tag w id=search (* is like wildcard))
//h1 (finds all h1 elements) !!! so here will i need to do something like allhvector=//h1 and get a vector kinda thing or what?
you can also do contains and starts with etc.
like
//div[contains(@class,'nav')] !!!what does contains nav mean? like wut
//a[starts-with(@href,'https://')]

btw if the thing is inside shadow root, youll still have to open it first <3
