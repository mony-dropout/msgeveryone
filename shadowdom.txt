yeah i guess i was unnecasarily intimidated by shadow dom lol,
 even if it is maybe complicated to actually write the website 
 code, in selenium, its not that tough, we just go to the element
  in insopect element that we wanna interact w/ -> we see if its in
   shadow dom by seeing if they have writen #shadow-root open somewhere->
    do sh=driver.find_element(by.id or wtv, "name of div which contains shadow dom")-> 
    do sr=driver.execute_script("return arguments[0].shadowroot",sh)
     (which im guessing will just return all elements inside the shadow dom ->
      then we just search elements inside it by x=sr.find_element(wtv method suits you) :)
