#you should do this coures in C++ pls, its not that tough, just get a normal compiler from like codeforces or some shit, i dont wanna learn
#python just so i can do these simple ass boring problems while i can do USACO gold and project euler in c++

n=int(input())
n=n%26
if n==0: 
    print(z)

    print(chr(96+n)) #wow chatgpt said pnly diff is python uses chr, wtv that supposed to mean, why not just char lmao
#also, wow, such an interesting star question, idk how anyone will be able to solve this, feel like im back in school, gimme my plastic star lol
