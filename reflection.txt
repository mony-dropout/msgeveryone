mony i did this shit right, we had fun, we worked hard and we built this
i wanted to give up so many times,
take the easy way out so many times, but you know what, i just kept pushing and pushing and i built this shit right?
we can do anything man, for real, belive that we can achieve anything
i can learn so much math, cs, coding, basketball, i can drop out of iit delhi in 2 years and be a fucking startup billionaire
man live out your dreams bruh for real, working hard every single day is literally the dream man, every single day do your best 
push past exhaustion every single day, every single night go to sleep exhausted and satisfied and wake up every single day with optimism and excited... 
you can do anything
be the hardest wokring kid every single day
acheive all your dreams
enjoy the journey
ALL THE WAY UP
